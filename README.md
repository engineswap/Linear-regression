# Linear regression
Basic linear regression model

To find a best fit line we need to use the form y=mx+b
-since we know our coordinates we need to find the slope and y intercept

finding slope:

 r = Pearsons Correlation Coeficient
 Sᵧ= Standard Deviation of the all the y's of the coordinates
 Sₓ= Standard Deviation of the all the x's of the coordinates
 
 r is found as such:

 Standard Deviation can be found with:

 To find the Y-intercept we use the formula:

# Purpose
The purpose of this project for me was to dabble into AI and some more math heavy programming, I understand this isnt any fancy AI but none the less, it was interesting to work on.
# How to run
```
1.) Download the repository
2.) Open index.html
```
You will see a page like this:

It shows you the points it used, and the line formula.
You can change the points it uses within the ``regression.js`` file.
