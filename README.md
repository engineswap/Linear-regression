Math

To find a best fit line we need to use the form y=mx+b
-since we know our coordinates we need to find the slope and y intercept

finding slope:

 r = Pearsons Correlation Coeficient
 Sᵧ= Standard Deviation of the all the y's of the coordinates
 Sₓ= Standard Deviation of the all the x's of the coordinates
 
 r is found as such:
